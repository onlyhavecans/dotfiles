This directory contains a vim script that allows reading notmuch mail
through vim.

NOTE: this is a work in progress.  Patches welcome. <bart@jukie.net>

Dependencies:
    notmuch:
        Naturally, it expects you have notmuch installed and configured.

    sendmail:
        To send mail, notmuch.vim uses sendmail as default.  Most modern MTAs
        provide a compatibility binary, and so should work well.


To install:
        make install


To run:
        vim -c ':NotMuch'

    from vim:
        :NotMuch
        :NotMuch new to:bart@jukie.net 'subject:this is a test'
