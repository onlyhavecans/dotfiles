# tBunnyMan dotfiles #
Yet another dotfiles repo.

## Notes ##
I stole my Rakefile from https://github.com/holman/dotfiles

## Apps ##
### zsh ###
* zsh is my new shell. So the config fu is weak.
* Also since I am new to it I'm not using oh-my-zsh, I prefer to learn from the ground up

### tinyfugue ###
* The configuration here is social muck oriented
* The world.tiny is ignored but an example is included

### vim ###
* Some but not all of the bundles are git linked
* The configuration is python oriented

### git ###
* The gitignore_global is mac/python oriented
* gitconfig is missing
